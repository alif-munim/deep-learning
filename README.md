# Deep Learning
A repository of projects exploring the world of deep learning, and its applications in image recognition, natural language understanding, and more.

### Cats v. Dogs
Ì∏∏ [image-classifier](https://github.com/alif-munim/deep-learning/blob/master/image-classification/logistic_regression_nn.ipynb)

A basic, single neuron image classifier that uses logistic regression to differentiate between cats and dogs. This was my first ever deep learning project, and it worked pretty well! Trained on a dataset from a [2013 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) containing 25,000 images of cats and dogs.

### Finger Digits
Ì±å [tf-hand-signs](https://github.com/alif-munim/deep-learning/blob/master/tf-hand-signs/hand-signs.ipynb)
My second image classification project, this time a multi-class classification problem for which I had to make use of the softmax function. This was my first time using TensorFlow, and it was quite nice compared to creating neural networks from scratch with NumPy! 

### TensorFlow Melanoma Classification
Ì¥ç [tf-skin-cancer](https://github.com/alif-munim/deep-learning/tree/master/tf-skin-cancer)
Classifying benign and malignant skin lesions using over 25,000 images from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) grand challenge archive.
